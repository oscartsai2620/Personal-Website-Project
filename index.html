                    Hello, my name is Oscar Tsai. I am from Taiwan, and I am currently a student at Texas A&M University pursing a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science. I am interested in many computer science fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, software development, computer networking, computer architecture and all kinds of knowledge about programming.

                    My Hobbies:
                </h2>
                <p class="Hobbies-describe">
                    During my spare time, I like to play basketball, weight lift, hangout with friends, study new fashion trends, attend concerts, and play video games. Sometimes I also like to watch sports like the <a href="https://www.nba.com/">NBA</a> , badminton, and fencing. On top of that, I am also really instered in the Korean culture. I have self-taught myself Korean, and I would always watch Korean dramas and variety shows to practice my Korean skills. I wish one day I can have the opportunity to find a job in Korea and experience the life over there.

                        My Journey:
                    </h3>
                    <p class="Journey-p">
                        I moved from Taiwan to the United States when I was 12 years old. At first, it was really hard to adapt to the environment due to the language barriers and culture differences between Taiwan and America. Despite these challenges, I was able to maintain a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 4.0 throughout my middle school and high school years, graduating in the top 1% of my class. Throughout the years as a student, I participated in a variety of activities outside of school like piano lessons, martial art, track and field, and I joined some service organizations like <a href="https://www.keyclub.org/">Key Club</a>. After graduating from high school, I moved to Houston for higher education and decided to study computer science while working at a part time job. In my junior of college, I had the opportunity to transfer to Texas A&M University, and since then I have been focusing on my academics for my future career.
