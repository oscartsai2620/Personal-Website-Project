                My Interest in Computer Science:
            </header>
            <p id="Explaination">
                The computer science fileds that I am most interested in is machine learning. This is also the reason why I am studying a computer science degree with a statistics focus. The reason why I like machine learning is because I personally think it is really fascinating that we can let machines to predict the results we want to know. Machine learning is like treating a machine like a child and use data to slowly train it to make decisions correctly and morally like human-beings. Even though the predictions being made by these machines are not always correct, we can still get a grasp of the general direction that can lead us to the correct answer. In recent years, many machines we use daily have incorporated machine learning. I believe machine learning can gradually make positive impacts to our lives and society.
